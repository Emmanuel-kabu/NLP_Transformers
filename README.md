Introduction
Emotion detection from text refers to the process of analyzing the sentiment of a piece of text and categorizing it into one of several emotion categories (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, etc.). This project uses a DistilBERT model, a lightweight version of BERT, fine-tuned for emotion classification tasks.

Model Architecture

The emotion detection model is based on DistilBERT, a smaller and faster version of the BERT transformer model, pretrained on a large corpus of text. The model is fine-tuned on an emotion-labeled dataset to predict emotions from given text.
